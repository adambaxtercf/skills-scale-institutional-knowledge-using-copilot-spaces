# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach delivers customer value through cross-functional teamwork, iterative development, and clear ownership. Projects begin with a structured initiation process—defining business problems, identifying stakeholders, and setting measurable success criteria—to foster transparency and alignment from the start.

Core roles are clearly defined within our organization: Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Product Managers prioritize the backlog and maintain product vision, and Developers build, test, and deliver solutions. Accountability and psychological safety are prioritized to encourage learning and continuous feedback throughout the project lifecycle.

## Key Workflows

Planning breaks work into shippable increments within a prioritized backlog, mapping dependencies, risks, and milestones. Sprint planning focuses on realistic scope and acceptance criteria. The project board (e.g., GitHub Projects) guides work across columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done. Daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and monthly stakeholder updates ensure visibility and cohesion, augmented by escalation paths for quick resolution of urgent issues.

## Quality Assurance

Quality assurance is embedded in every phase of our process. Automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) and CI pipelines support code quality; manual QA and smoke tests validate major releases. Releases follow checklist-driven procedures, complete with rollback/incident playbooks and thorough post-deployment verification. Retrospectives ensure continuous improvement, with learnings converted into actionable backlog items and regularly tracked.

## Risk Management & Communication

Risk management and communication leverage clear documentation and escalation protocols. Risk registers, decision logs, and templates for weekly status/incident reporting enable transparent updates and stakeholder engagement. By combining structured workflows, role clarity, robust QA, and communication, OctoAcme's process delivers high-quality results while adapting to change and capturing institutional knowledge.
